I feel so high school
Every time I look at you
I want to find you in a crowd
Just to hide from you

And in the blink of a crinkling eye
I′m sinking, our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I′ll drink what you think and I'm high from smoking your jokes all
damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
I'm watching American Pie
With you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I′m trying to stifle my sighs,
cause I feel so high school
every time I look at you
But look at you

Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?
It′s just a game, but really
I'm betting on all three
For us two
Get my car door, isn′t that sweet
Then pull me to the backseat
No one's ever had me
Not like you ...

Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball
I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play grand theft auto
It′s true, swear, Scout's honor
You knew what you wanted
And, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe

I feel like laughing
In the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again
I′m hearing voices, like a madman

And in the blink of a crinkling eye
I'm sinking, our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I′ll drink what you think and I′m high from smoking your jokes all
damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
I'm watching American Pie
With you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I′m trying to stifle my sighs,
cause I feel so high school
every time I look at you
But look at you

Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball
I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, Scout′s honor
You knew what you wanted
And, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe
You already know, babe
