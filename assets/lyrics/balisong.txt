Found myself stranded in visions of your
Mysterious stare beautiful hair
I can't quite explain it the way you've transformed
Left me in awe of you

You changed the world that I once knew
Transformin' everythin' to paradise with you
You and I are melodies
Dancin' forever our love is a symphony

Never in my life have I been more sure
Nobody's made me feel this way before
Never in my life have I been more sure
You're everything I wanted

Never in my life have I been more sure
Nobody's made me feel this way before
Never in my life have I been more sure
You're everything I wanted

You are my sun in my skies
You are the days in my nights baby
You're everything I wanted
You are the reason I smile
You put the worth in my while baby
You're everything I wanted

Never in my life have I been more sure
You're everything I wanted
