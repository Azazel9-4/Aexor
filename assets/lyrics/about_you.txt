I know a place
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
We get married in our heads
Something to do whilst we try to recall how we met

Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten about you?

You and I
Were alive
With nothing to do I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait and pretend
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end

Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten about you?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten about you?

There was something about you that now I can't remember
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
And I'll miss you on a train
I'll miss you in the morning
I never know what to think about, so think about you
(I think about you)
About you
Do you think I have forgotten about you?
About you
About you
Do you think I have forgotten about you?
